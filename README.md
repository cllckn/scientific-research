# Research in the Field of Information Technologies

## Course Description

This course introduces scientific research in the field of Information Technology through practical, experiment-driven 
learning. Students develop research skills by formulating research problems and hypotheses, designing controlled and 
reproducible experiments, evaluating system and algorithm performance, analyzing experimental results, and documenting 
findings in the form of a scientific research article. The course emphasizes empirical evaluation of IT systems and 
data-driven solutions, aligning research methodology with real-world IT practices.
